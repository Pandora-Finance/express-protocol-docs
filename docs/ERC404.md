**Note: Completing this step is essential for authorizing token transfers.**
### Step 4: Execute Token Transfers and View on Marketplaces
- **Disclaimer:** When you transfer ERC-20 tokens from an ERC-404 collection, it triggers a corresponding transfer of ERC-721 tokens. This means that the number of ERC-721 tokens equivalent to the transferred ERC-20 tokens will be minted in the recipient's wallet, while an equivalent number will be burned from the sender's wallet.

- Navigate to the "Transfer tokens" section. Here, you’re required to enter - **Collection Address, Receiver's Wallet Address, and Token Count.** Confirm the transfer by clicking on **"Confirm Transfer."**
- Authorize the transaction through your wallet.
- Upon successful transfer, a confirmation message will be displayed.
- View the transferred NFTs on **OpenSea and Rarible.**
### Step 5: Transfer Your NFT
- Connect with ERC404 Dapp using your crypto wallet.
- In the "Transfer NFT" section, input Collection Address, Receiver's Wallet Address, and "NFT Token ID."
- Finalize the process by clicking "Confirm Transfer."
- Confirm the transaction within your wallet.

- **Disclaimer:** When someone transfers an ERC-721 token, the same ERC-721 token will be transferred to another person, and an ERC-20 token will be automatically transferred as well. This means that when an ERC-721 token is sent, it triggers a simultaneous transfer of both the ERC-721 token itself and an ERC-20 token to the recipient.
